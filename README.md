The NSL Mapper is a webservices broker service that maps URIs to Services using content negotiation. It was designed for
the National Species List, but can be used for any web service that need persistent URIs mapped to resources.

It was developed at the Australian National Botanic Gardens in association with CHAH, the ALA and the IBIS team.

The mapper is a work in progress, we'll be adding a roadmap and more doco here as we go.
